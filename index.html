                <h2>Hey, I'm Trevor</h2>
                <p class = "">I'm a senior at East Carolina University. I expect to graduate in May with a B.S. in Computer Science.
                    I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania riding bikes and playing in the woods, as any kid does.
                    I moved to North Carolina before high school.  There I learned to surf and resent humidity.  As an adult I moved
                    back to Pennsylvania to catch up with old friends and reconnect with the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got interested in computer science and programming when I was working as a store manager at a computer 
                    sales and repair shop near Philadelphia, PA.  I took some programming courses at the local community 
                    college and fell in love.  I returned to North Carolina a year or so later to pursue my degree at East Carolina University. 
                    As I said earlier, I plan to graduate this spring and hopefully continue my studies in ECU's graduate C.S. program.
